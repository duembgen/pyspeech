This repostiroy was created for a python exercice session for http://powercoders.org/ in March 2017. 

This repository is not maintained currently. However, if you are looking for a fun lesson for learning the basics of python through interactive and fun exercices, feel free to reuse this code. If you have some contributions to share, I am happy to process pull requests.
